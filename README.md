# ACWallpaper0020 or Animal Crossing Wallpaper 0020

A small scene intented to be used as a wallpaper for the tool called Wallpaper Engine.
It is based on the videogame Animal Crossing by Nintendo and has a Bass.Net lib implementation
to detect BPM in real time from desktop audio.

The idea is based on this video: [youtube.com/watch?v=yD2FSwTy2lw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD2FSwTy2lw) from JerryTerry.

## Objectives
With this project I aim to learn a few things:
-Unity (Not my 1st project with this tool).
-Github with Unity.
-C#.
-Use of an external lib.
-Create basic Blender Animations.
-Use of Toggle as time tracking.
-Use of Trello as a workflow board.
-Lear to implement pre made shaders.
-If possible, create my own shaders.

## Extra info:
This is not my first try at this but, previously I had problems with the shaders after updating Unity, so I find
a bit faster to port everything into a new project than trying to fix the previous one.
All character models were found as free online resources at [models-resource.com](www.models-resource.com) .
